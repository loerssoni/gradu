# Momentum: autocovariances, cross-covariances or unconditional expected returns?

A stripped down version of the R script used for my master's thesis on the decomposition of momentum. Link to the thesis text will be added after the thesis has been reviewed. This stripped down version of the script contains function definitions and produces baseline results for each portion of the paper.
For the rest of the results reported in the thesis, the code has been rerun with some alternating specifications. These specifications can be found in the script as commented out lines.
